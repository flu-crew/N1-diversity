"BEASTrunPlanApr2.xlsx" is my job submission plan for my first attempt at using BEAST to answer several questions:
Clade Questions:
1) Are clades evolving quickly or slowly?
2) How has each clade's diversity changed over time?

Lineage Questiotns:
3) What Does the evolionary rate of each lineage look like?
4) What reassortments have takes place, and have any of them persisted?
5) How has N1 diversity in each lineage changed over time?

lines 2-14 seek to address questions 1-2 and lines 15-18 seek to address questions 3-5

replicates are biological replicates of independent samples, rather than technical replicates

All runs will use a 10% burnin
